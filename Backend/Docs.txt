This back end assumes your front end produces a lowered IR like:

IRProgram → groups

IRGroup → processes, channels, schedule

IRProcess → states → actions + transition (with then/else action lists)

Actions include Send/Receive/TrySend/TryReceive/Assign

Transitions include Goto and IfElse (with then/else actions lists)

It also implements your latest requirements:

Result + ? desugared to __Error state

Preserve error payload automatically

Auto-write __last_error:text on ? failure

Group-local channels are visible to processes (enforced earlier in sema; runtime uses resolved ids)

try_send / try_receive return Result<bool,text> / Result<T,text>

Deterministic blocking semantics, fixed schedule, deadlock detection

Trace format (tick + process-step + channel buffers)

--check-only is front end; backend provides clean exit signals (Completed, Deadlock)
