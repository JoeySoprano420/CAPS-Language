## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install CAPS compiler (see HOWTO.md)
- Basic programming knowledge

### Hello World
Create `hello.caps`:
```
module hello

group Main {
  process Hello -> () {
    state Start
    on Start { -> Start }  // Infinite loop
  }

  schedule { step Hello; repeat }
}
```

Compile: `caps_frontend --emit-cpp=gen --compile hello.caps`

This creates a simple program that runs forever.
