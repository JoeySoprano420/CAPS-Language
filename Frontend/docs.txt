How to build and run (Visual Studio)

Open Visual Studio → Open a local folder → select caps/

VS detects CMakeLists.txt

Build caps_frontend

Run:

caps_frontend demo/demo.caps


It should print an IR summary where:

transitions carry then/else action lists

rr? becomes TryUnwrapAssign ... on_fail state=__Error write __last_error

Notes (so you don’t get surprised)

This is a front end: it does not execute programs.

It enforces the rules you asked for at parse+sema time.

It’s intentionally strict: total transitions require else, and ? is banned in transition conditions.
