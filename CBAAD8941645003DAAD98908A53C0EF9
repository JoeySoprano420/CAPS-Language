### Why CAPS? Deterministic Concurrency Without the Complexity
Posted: 2023-10-01

CAPS-Language offers a fresh take on concurrent programming. Unlike threads or async/await, CAPS enforces determinism at compile-time through explicit state machines and bounded channels.

Key benefits:
- No race conditions
- Predictable execution
- Strong static guarantees
